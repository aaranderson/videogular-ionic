# Videogular-ionic

Using Videogular together with ionic in a simple project

This was a test if I can get videogular working within a cordova / ionic project. Actually it worked on an android 4.4 phone.

If you want to build the project in Android for example
* add the android plattform: <code>cordova platform add android</code>
* build the project  <code>corodva build android</code>
* run the project with USB debugging enabled <code>ionic run android</code>

execute all commands at project root level.

Installed software which is needed:
* apache cordova (for plugins)
* ionic
